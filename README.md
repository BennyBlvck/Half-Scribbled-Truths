# ✍🏾 Half Scribbled Truths – Landing Page Project

A simple, clean, and responsive landing page designed as part of my journey to relearn and sharpen my full stack web development skills after almost a 2-year break. This project is both a memory refresher and a creative exercise tied to my personal blog **Half Scribbled Thoughts**, where I share poetry, short stories, and written reflections.

## 🧠 Purpose

This page was built to:
- Revisit and solidify core HTML, CSS, and layout skills
- Practice clean, readable code structure
- Design intuitive, mobile-friendly user interfaces
- Prepare for more complex front-end projects
- Build muscle memory through daily landing page creations

## 🚀 Features

- Fully responsive design
- Clean, minimal layout with modern web fonts
- Simple Mailchimp-style newsletter form layout
- Placeholder elements for future API or backend integration
- Easy to modify and extend for other landing page experiments

## 📚 Learning Goals

- Reinforce layout and responsive design techniques
- Rebuild front-end intuition through repetition and experimentation
- Sharpen HTML/CSS fluency before diving deeper into React, APIs, and backend integrations
- Create a growing collection of landing page variations as daily learning exercises

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3 (Vanilla CSS)
- [Optional] Font: Google Fonts
- Designed for future integration with form handling (e.g., Mailchimp, Firebase, custom backend)

## 📌 Project Status

This is the first in a growing series of mini front-end builds. I will continue to push new variations as I maintain my weekly learning habit to regain full-stack fluency.
